# Tesseract play

**Goal**: Read and parse receipts. Food shopping, restaurant

Using [naptha/tesseract](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)

## Get started

1. `npm i`
2. Set image path in `index.js`
3. `npm start`

Currently can read a receipt as long as its got good contrast and clear. Used basic implementation not recommended for production.
